### 🔒 Security Testing Capabilities:

#### OWASP Top 10 2021 Coverage:
✅ A01:2021 – Broken Access Control
✅ A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures
✅ A03:2021 – Injection
✅ A04:2021 – Insecure Design
✅ A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration
✅ A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components
✅ A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures
✅ A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures
✅ A09:2021 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
✅ A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

#### Advanced Testing Modules:
- 🔐 **Authentication Testing**: SQL injection in login, timing attacks, credential transport
- 🍪 **Session Management**: Cookie security, session fixation, predictability analysis
- 🌐 **API Security**: Endpoint discovery, rate limiting, mass assignment, excessive data exposure
- 💼 **Business Logic**: Workflow bypass, race conditions, price manipulation
- 🎯 **Advanced Payloads**: XSS, SQLi, XXE, SSRF with evasion techniques

#### Technical Features:
- 🚀 **Real-time Scanning**: Live progress updates and logging
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Charts for vulnerability distribution and OWASP coverage
- 📋 **Multiple Report Formats**: PDF, JSON, XML, CSV exports
- ⚙️ **Configurable Settings**: Threading, timeouts, proxies, authentication
- 🎭 **Scan Profiles**: Quick, Comprehensive, Stealth, and API-focused modes

### 🚀 Quick Start Instructions:

1. **Download Files**: Save all created files to a directory
2. **Make Executable**: `chmod +x start.sh`
3. **Run**: `./start.sh`
4. **Access**: Open browser to `http://localhost:5000`
5. **Start Testing**: Enter target IP and begin scanning
